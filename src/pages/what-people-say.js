      <p>
        I have worked with Purcell Communications since I arrived at Overture
        Center in 2008. Ruth has served a number of roles at Overture, including
        filling in as our Publicist and our Vice President of Sales and
        Marketing while we conducted searches for both positions. For many
        years, she and her colleague Sallie Braun collaborated on our marketing
        strategies and handled our media buying for our diverse season of
        performances and organizational messaging. I have found them to be
        knowledge, responsive and hard-working. I could trust that they could
        get the job completed efficiently and effectively.
